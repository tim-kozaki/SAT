## Background
The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):

* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html)).

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, SAT scores show a strong correlation to the education/qualifications of graduate's parents. 
Possible reasons could be better financial support for tutoring, college applications and tuition. Further investigation is required to understand this trend better. 

Although Asians make up a small portion of the overal test takers, they have the highest average SAT score, Evidence-based Reading and Writing scores, and Math scores. Their average scores is in an increasing trend each year from 2017 to 2019. 

White population make up the majority of test takers with SAT scores that are comparable to Asians. 

Hispanics/Latinos, Black/African Americans, Native American Indians require assistance to boost their average SAT scores. 

### Recommendation from other domains
My other teammates had covered the impact and corresponding recommendation from their study on race demographic , finanicial aid , states and college major. These will be summarised in the PDF / PPT slide decks in another document.
